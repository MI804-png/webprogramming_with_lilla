## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of TechCorp Solutions seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
- **Email**: security@techcorp.com (or your team email)

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment**: Our security team will investigate and assess the vulnerability.
3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress in addressing the vulnerability.
4. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will:
   - Develop and test a fix
   - Release a security update
   - Publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired)

### Security Update Process

- Security fixes are prioritized and released as soon as possible
- Updates are announced via GitHub Security Advisories
- All security updates are documented in the CHANGELOG

## Security Best Practices

When deploying TechCorp Solutions, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys) to version control
2. **Database**: Use strong passwords for database users and restrict access appropriately
3. **Session Secret**: Use a strong, randomly generated SESSION_SECRET in production
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
5. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date using Dependabot
6. **Access Control**: Implement proper role-based access control for admin functions
7. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
8. **Regular Updates**: Keep Node.js and npm updated to the latest stable versions

## Known Security Considerations

- The application uses crypto.createHash('sha256') for password hashing. For production use, consider migrating to bcrypt or argon2 for better security.
- Ensure PM2 is configured with proper user permissions on production servers
- Review and configure appropriate CSP (Content Security Policy) headers

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new security fix versions as soon as possible

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.
